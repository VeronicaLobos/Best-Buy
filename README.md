### My first OOP practice with Python

This is the first part of a project to learn how to create classes, and to help me understand basic OOP with Python.
WIP !!

##### Making nice code:

+ Type Hinting: Improved code readability, it will facilitate static analysis.
+ Docstrings: Explaining the purpose of each class, and the behaviour of each method, will improve maintainability.
+ Error Handling: Type checking, empty strings and negative values will cause errors when running the program.
+ Exception messages: Each error will raise different error messages, making debugging easier and to guide the user during interaction.

* Product class dynamic attribute: The instantiation will contain an "active" (bool) attribute, which will be initialized as True if the "quantity" (int) attribute is higher than zero, otherwise its value will be set to False.
